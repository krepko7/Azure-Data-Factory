# Azure Data Factory Workshops

This site is a map of learning content produced by and curated by Kirby Repko. These materials are meant to be instructor-led, but you can work through the materials on a test system on your own if desired. You can view all materials directly in this interface, or you can [view the raw github site for this content here](https://https://github.com/krepko7/Azure-Data-Factory).

## Learning how to self-learn

Many of these topics are quite deep, and take time to fully absorb. There are several phases of learning:

 - Awareness (You learn a technology exists and what it is used for)
 - Understanding (You learn the components, processes and steps of a technology)
 - Practice (You can perform the steps with the technology by following a process to complete a task)
 - Mastery (You are able to explain the technology to others)
